# Quantinuum Shopping Cart
The Quantinuum Projects are reference architecture for microservices. This project is a trivial implementation of a shopping cart service. It demonstrates a few basic concepts:

1. Using .NET Core and Nancyfx as a very lightweight framework and runtime.
2. Calling another microservice asynchronously with an adapter pattern.
3. Publish business events to an event store.
